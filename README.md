#Jordan's Idiot guide to Software Engineering
##For Engineers of a Non-Software Background
I hypothesize that Engineers/ "technically minded people" of a non-CS background can not only become competant engineers, but have a certain mentality that differentiates them from their CS cousins and gives them an advantage in certain areas. 
This guide (a work in progress) is intended to help non-software engineers learn software engineering.
Since it is intended for Engineers, this guide assumes that:

1. You already know how to math/ algebra, so we can skip over the basic parts of that
2. You're used to stuff being confusing and you know how to use google to find information. Don't expect to find everything you want in one single source and/or fall in your lap. You need to be an autodidact here.

##Choosing your Operating System
While this might get a lot of flack from the haters, you're probably going to want to use either OSX (That mac's OS) or some sort of Linux distro (If you're running Linux, why are you even reading this? You obviously know what the hell is going on). 
It is possible to program on Windows, but you'll find eventually that a unix "esque" system makes your life easier. Don't go out and buy a mac if you currently have a Windows computer, just stick with it for now and eventually you'll figure out why a lot of software engineers tend to use OSX/Linux.

##A list of MOOCs

If you just want a random list of quality sources to learn stuff online (and want to figure stuff out instead of reading this piece of art guide), here's a few that I recommend:

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/): Free, interactive, in-browser programming tutorials
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/): Free(ish) videos on programming
- [Jenkov's Tutorials](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/): Free, in-depth and very well written tutorials
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/): Free videos on basically everything, sorta structured like a high school course.
- [CrashCourse](https://www.khanacademy.org/): Free, high quality youtube videos, kinda like Khan Academy. 

##Learning the basics of how to program
Programming != (That means not equals to) Computer Science.
Programming is learning how to code, Computer Science is learning the underlying concepts behind what the hell is going on when you write code. Both are important, but let's start with programming

###Learn Python

####Baby Browser Programming
Python is probably the easiest langauge to learn (in my opinion). It has a syntax that is essentially plan english and it abstracts away more complex Computer Science principles so that you can focus on what matters initially: Learning to code.

[Codecademy's Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) is a great place to start. You don't have to download an IDE/ Editor/ Compiler/ Other terms that you may not understand at the moment, it's all in your browser. Do the entire thing, take notes. I recommend using [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/#quiver) or Evernote to take notes, but Quiver is designed for programmers so it's a bit more optimal.


####Python! Now on your machine!
Then, do it again, but harder: [Learn Python the hard way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). 

Protip: Instead of using TextWrangler as your local text editor like the above link states, I reccomend [Atom](http://atom.io/) instead. It's by Github and it's quickly becoming the standard text editor of choice for many software engineers (including me).

Disclaimer: I confess that I've gone through CodeCademy's Python course but only part of Learn Python the hard way, so I'm just adding it here based on what other software engineers have told me. If you feel that this shouldn't be part of this guide/ it's too redundant, then make a pull request to this document. If you don't know what a pull request is then you aren't experience enough to complain :P (yet).

In Learn Python the hard way, you want to again, keep taking notes, and re-enforce the concepts that you were first exposed to in Codecademy's Python Course.

Once you finish these two courses (might take you a while), you should understand variables, for loops, if statements, functions, other basic noob stuff, and start to get comfortable with classes.

###Object Oriented Programming, or OOP

This is a core concept of modern software programming. It's probably the most important one, realistically. I'll totally find a guide to explain this eventually.

##Computer Science

At this stage, you should be kinda familiar with programming and have started to scratch the surface of Computer Science. 

From what I've gathered, "Practical Computer Science" is essentially **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**

[Khan Academy's Algorithms course is a good place to start](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms), and I also recommend [Coursera's Algorithms, Part I](https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-010) course.

I'll add Data Structures and other CS courses here later once I find where I saved those links.

##Choose your allegiance: Mobile, Frontend, Backend

Ding! Grats! You're level 10 now. You get to put your first talent point in a specialization tree. 
In the current software engineering environment, there are three-ish main specializations:

1. Mobile: Writing Android and iOS apps (Windows phone too if you've a masochist, I guess).
2. Frontend: You make websites.
3. Backend: You make the database that websites and mobile apps talk to.

###Mobile

With Mobile, you are writing client (that means it runs locally on the smartphone) apps for Android and iOS phones, Android Wear and the AppleWatch, Android Auto and Car Kit, ect.

You're going to want to pick sub-spec (I played way too much wow as a kid) first and then learn the other later, if you want.

####Android
Java + XML (for your UI)
If you choose Android, you can target ~ 80-85% of the world's market. What's that? Everyone you know has an iPhone? iPhone only has a significant (~50%) market share in the states and some other first world countries.

With Android, you want to first learn Java (not Javascript) and then learn how to write Java for Android.

Once you have the basics of Java (and you let me know where you learn it), I recommend [Udacity's Android course](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853). It's an excellent start.

####iOS
Objective-C or Swift 
If you choose iOS, you're going to learn Objective-C or Swift, which are these languages that are only really used to write iOS or Mac apps at this point in time. While these languages can't be used for anything else, really (unlike Java), and iOS only has like 14% of the world's market share (as of 2015Q2), iOS Developers can actually make more money on their apps than Android Developers since iOS users tend to be yuppies with more money than sense [citation needed].

If you want to learn Objective-C (which is the old iOS language), I recommend [RyPress's Objective-C tutorial](http://rypress.com/tutorials/objective-c/index). 

If you want to learn Swift (which is the new iOS language), then go ask someone else because I don't know swift yet.

###Frontend
HTML, CSS, and JS

When making a website, here's what each part does:

HTML: The content of your website; text and images (the meat!)
CSS: The styling of your website, what size/ colors your text is, what spacing to use, all kinds of goofy shit!
JS (aka Javascript): Anything kinda complicated

First, learn [HTML and CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web). It's pretty easy tbh.

Then learn [Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript). It's pretty easy but a little harder.

Then let me know once you get to this point and I'll update the guide.

###Backend
All the languages! 

I'll get to this eventually if there's enough demand
